# ZombieLunging

## Editor's notes

I would recommend binding the command to a key by typing this in the console:
```
cmdbind <key> .lunge
```

## Config
```yml
zl_enable: true
zl_lunge_time: 5
zl_slow_time: 3
zl_slow_amount: 25
zl_penalty_time: 3
zl_victim_message: null
zl_penalty_message: null
zl_lunge_message: null
zl_lunge_cooldown: 10
zl_lunge_cooldown_message: You are currently on a cooldown, you can lunge again in <color=#ff0000>{time}</color> seconds.
```

## Commands
```
.lunge
```

*The command is for the player console.*
